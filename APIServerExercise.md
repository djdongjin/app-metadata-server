# Coding Exercise - Application Metadata API Server

## Requirements

* Build a Golang RESTful API server for application metadata.
* An endpoint to persist application metadata (In memory is fine). The API must support YAML as a valid payload format.
* An endpoint to search application metadata and retrieve a list that matches the query parameters.
* Include tests if you feel itâ€™s appropriate.

We've provided example yaml data payloads. Two that should persist, and two that should error due to missing fields.

## "Rules"

Use golang for the server, but any other software or open source libraries are fair game to help you solve this problem. The response from the server as well as the structure of the query endpoint is intentionally vague to allow latitude in your solution.

## Advice

This exercise is an opportunity to show off your passion and the craftsmanship of your solution. Optimize your solution for quality and reliability. If you feel your solution is missing a cool feature and you have time, have fun and add it. Make the solution your own, and show off your skills.

## What about the database?

It's recommended that you don't use a database. Integrating with a database driver or ORM gives you less room to shine, and us less ability to evaluate your work.

## Example payloads

All fields in the payload are required. For illustration purposes, we have a few example payloads. One example payload where the maintainer email is not a valid email and another where the version is missing that should fail on submit and two that should be valid.
